Explanation of the cryptography behind Bitcoin

Bitcoin's transactions are secured by the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA)
and its blockchain is secured through the use of cryptographic hash functions. 
We will see how elliptic curves over finite fields secure the ECDSA through the ECDLP 
and examine the properties of cryptographic hash functions that make them so useful throughout the Bitcoin protocol.
